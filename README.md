## Foundations

### Simple
Harlem has a simple functional API for creating, reading and mutating state. At it's heart, Harlem just uses Vue reactive objects and computeds which means if you know how to use Vue, you'll know how to use Harlem.

### Unopinionated
Harlem doesn't impose any standards or conventions on your codebase. Because of it's simple functional API you can structure your code any way you want and Harlem will just work.

### Immutable
All state provided from a Harlem store is immutable by default. The only write access to state is through actions and mutations. This ensures all updates to your store are tracable, thereby reducing the amount of bugs produced by code unpredictably mutating state.

### Lightweight
Harlem core weighs in at around 1.5KB (minified & gzipped) which makes it the perfect solution for codebases of all sizes. It is also designed to be tree-shakable - unused stores, getters, actions, or mutations will be removed from your code at build time (provided you are using a build tool that supports tree-shaking). 

It's also worth noting that Harlem has **zero** dependencies.

### Extensible
Harlem is architectured with extensibility in mind so you can extend it any way you want through [extensions](/extensibility/extensions/) and [plugins](/extensibility/plugins/). Some of the official plugins and extensions include Vue devtools integration, advanced actions, local/session storage sync, history (undo/redo) and more.

### Great DX
Harlem has a great developer experience. It's built using TypeScript so all of your state, getters, actions and mutations are strongly typed. Harlem also has devtools integration so you can explore your stores and see mutation events on the timeline in realtime.


## Features

### Powerfully simple

Harlem boasts a simple yet powerful API. The core package comes with everything you need to get started with state management such as state, getters, actions and mutations.

By keeping the core feature set lightweight it means even the simplest project can use Harlem without incurring the cost of unneeded features.

Need more than the core set? Check out the great range of official [extensions](/extensibility/extensions/introduction.html) and [plugins](/extensibility/plugins/introduction.html) for adding features such as advanced actions, lazy getters, devtools, ssr and more.

### TypeScript support
Harlem is built on TypeScript which means you get rich TypeScript support out of the box. Types can be automatically inferred nearly everywhere state is used, the only place you will have to explicitly define types is for payload objects.

```typescript
export const loadDetails = action('load-details', async (id: string, mutate) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/details/${id}`);
    const details = await response.json();

    mutate(state => {
        state.details = details;
    });
});
```

Not using TypeScript? Not to worry - Harlem works just as well without it.


### Devtools integration

Harlem fully supports Vue devtools integration through the [Harlem devtools plugin](/extensibility/plugins/devtools.html). Install `@harlem/plugin-devtools` and register it with your Harlem plugin:

```typescript
import App from './app.vue';
import Harlem from '@harlem/core';

import createDevtoolsPlugin from '@harlem/plugin-devtools';

import {
    createApp
} from 'vue';

function start() {
    let plugins = [];

    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        plugins.push(createDevtoolsPlugin({
            label: 'State'
        }));
    }

    return createApp(App)
        .use(Harlem, {
            plugins
        })
        .mount('#app');
}

start();
```

See the [devtools plugin docs](/extensibility/plugins/devtools.html) for more information on the options available. 


### Server-side rendering

Harlem supports using stores in an SSR application via the [SSR plugin](/extensibility/plugins/server-side-rendering.html) (`@harlem/plugin-ssr`). Refer to the SSR plugin documentation for more information and how to get started.


## Getting started
Getting started is simple:

1. Install `@harlem/core` and any extensions/plugins you wish to include (it is recommended to install `@harlem/plugin-devtools` during development):
```bash
yarn add @harlem/core
# or
npm install @harlem/core
```

2. Register the Harlem plugin with your Vue app instance:
```typescript
import App from './app.vue';
import Harlem from '@harlem/core';

createApp(App)
    .use(Harlem)
    .mount('#app');
```

3. Create your store and write any getters/mutations:
```typescript
import {
    createStore
} from '@harlem/core';

const STATE = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Smith'
};

const {
    getter,
    action,
    ...store
} = createStore('user', STATE);

export const state = store.state;
export const fullName = getter('fullname', state => `${state.firstName} ${state.lastName}`);
export const setFirstName = mutation('set-first-name', (state, payload) => state.firstName = payload);
export const setLastName = mutation('set-last-name', (state, payload) => state.lastName = payload);

export const loadDetails = action('load-details', async (id: string, mutate) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/details/${id}`);
    const details = await response.json();

    mutate(state => {
        state.details = details;
    });
});
```

4. Use your store in your app:
```html
<template>
    <div class="app">
        <h1>Hello {{ fullName }}</h1>
        <button @click="loadDetails()">Load Details</button>
        <input type="text" v-model="firstName" placeholder="First name">
        <input type="text" v-model="lastName" placeholder="Last name">
    </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import {
    defineComponent,
    computed
} from 'vue';

import {
    state,
    fullName,
    setFirstName,
    setLastName,
    loadDetails
} from './stores/user';

const firstName = computed({
    get: () => state.firstName,
    set: value => setFirstName(value)
});

const lastName = computed({
    get: () => state.lastName,
    set: value => setLastName(value)
});
</script>
```

## Core concepts

Harlem, much like Vuex, follows a Redux-like state management pattern. Harlem's functionality can be divided into 3 main concepts:
- State - The single source of truth for your data (read-only).
- Getters - Computed side-effects of mutations to state (read-only).
- Mutations - The means by which state is changed (read/write).
- Actions - Async methods for batching mutations, api requests etc (async read/write). Advanced actions are available with the [action extension](extensions/action) (@harlem/extension-action).

Where Harlem differs from Vuex is that as opposed to having one monolithic state tree, Harlem uses the concept of stores to create logical boundaries between disparate data.

### State

The state tree is the single source of truth for any given store. Once a store has been created, the state tree is strictly **readonly**. The initial state for a store is defined upon store creation.


```typescript
const STATE = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Smith'
};

const {
    state
} = createStore('user', STATE);

state.firstName = 'Jane'; // This will throw an error
```

### Getters

If you have used Vuex before you will likely be familiar with the concept of a `getter`. A `getter` is a computed store property that is automatically updated when state changes.

Getters are particularly useful for joining different parts of state together or mapping data. In Harlem getters are always **readonly**.

To define a getter simply import the getter function returned from the `createStore` method. The getter function takes 2 arguments - a name, and a callback with a single `state` parameter.

```typescript
const STATE = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Smith'
};

const {
    getter
} = createStore('user', STATE);

export const fullName = getter('fullname', state => `${state.firstName} ${state.lastName}`);
```

The getter function returns a Vue computed property that can now be used in your components or even other getters.

### Mutations

Mutations are the foundation of Harlem. A mutation is the only means by which state can be mutated. This is to ensure every change to state is predictable and auditable.

Mutations are simple functions that take a payload in, mutate state, and optionally return a result.

```typescript
const STATE = {
    name: 'John Smith',
    traits: []
};

const {
    mutation
} = createStore('user', STATE);

// This mutation takes a string payload and updates the name field
export const setName = mutation<string>('set-name', (state, name) => state.name = name);

// This mutation takes a string payload, adds a trait to the list and returns it's id
export const addTrait = mutation<string, symbol>('add-trait', (state, payload) => {
    const traitId = Symbol(payload);

    state.traits.push({
        id: traitId,
        value: payload
    });

    return traitId;
});

/*
Usage

setName('Jane Smith');

const traitId = addTrait('funny');
*/
```

### Actions

Actions are asynchronous methods that often batch network requests with one or more state mutations. Because action implementations can vary widely Harlem only includes a very basic actions implementation by default in the core package. A more advanced action implementation is available through the [action extension](extensions/action) (@harlem/extension-action).

```typescript
export default action('load-details', async (id: string, mutate) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/details/${id}`);
    const details = await response.json();

    mutate(state => {
        state.details = details;
    });

    return details;
});

/*
Usage

const details = await loadDetails('user-id');
*/
```

The advanced action implementation in the Harlem action extension includes features like cancellation, nested actions and indirect status checks. See that [action extension](extensions/action) documentation for more information.

### Triggers

Triggers allow you to react to global or specific store events. Harlem uses an event-driven model to remain fast and lean while still providing flexible plugin hooks. The upside to this is that you can hook into specific Harlem events and react to them.

Triggers are particularly useful for reacting to certain mutations to perform async tasks. For instance, a trigger would allow you to send state back to a server after certain mutations.

```typescript
const {
    on,
    once,
    onBeforeMutation,
    onAfterMutation,
    onMutationSuccess,
    onMutationError,
    onBeforeAction,
    onAfterAction,
    onActionSuccess,
    onActionError,
} = createStore('user', STATE);

onMutationSuccess('my-mutation-name', event => {
    saveState();
});
```


## Extensibility

Harlem uses a combination of extensions and plugins to extend core functionality. 

### Extensions

Extensions are per-store additions to Harlem's core functionaility. Extensions are often used for adding store features, changing store behaviour and various other low-level tasks. This is the primary method in which Harlem stores are extended. Feel free to choose from some of the official extensions or write your own. See the [extensions documentation](extensions) from more information on the official set of extensions or how to author your own plugin.

The official extensions include:

- [Action](extensions/action) (`@harlem/extension-action`) - Extends a store to support advanced actions (cancellation, status & error tracking etc.).
- [Compose](extensions/compose) (`@harlem/extension-compose`) - Extends a store to to add simple read/write convenience methods.
- [History (preview)](extensions/history) (`@harlem/extension-history`) - Extends a store to support undo and redo capabilities.
- [Lazy](extensions/lazy) (`@harlem/extension-lazy`) - Extends a store to support lazy async getters.
- [Storage](extensions/storage) (`@harlem/extension-storage`) - Extends a store to support synchronising state to/from `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
- [Trace](extensions/trace) (`@harlem/extension-trace`) - Extends a store to support tracing granular changes to state during mutations. Useful for auditing during development.
- [Transaction](extensions/transaction) (`@harlem/extension-transaction`) - Extends a store to support rolling back multiple mutations if one fails. 

### Plugins

Plugins are global extensions to Harlem's core functionality. Plugins are often used for generic store operations like tracking events and collating state. Feel free to choose from some of the official plugins or write your own. See the [plugins documentation](plugins) from more information on the official set of plugins or how to author your own plugin.

The official plugins include:

- [Devtools](plugins/devtools) (`@harlem/plugin-devtools`) - The devtools plugin adds Vue devtools integration with your stores to show updates to your state in realtime.
- [SSR](plugins/ssr) (`@harlem/plugin-ssr`) - The SSR plugin enables support for using Harlem stores in a server-side rendered application.


## FAQ

### Can I share state between stores?
Certainly - just import the state or getter from one store into the getter you are authoring on another store. For example:

```typescript
import {
    state as otherState
} from '../other-store';

import {
    getter
} from './store';

export const myNumberGetter = getter('my-number', state => state.myNumber +  otherState.otherNumber);
```

This also works for importing getters from other stores. Just remember that to access the value of a getter you will need to use the `.value` property of the getter. For example, if I had a getter name `myGetter` and I wanted to use it in another getter I would have to use `myGetter.value` to access it's raw value. 

See the Vue documentation on computeds for more information. [Vue Computed](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/computed-watch-api.html#computed).


### Does Harlem have a file structure convention for stores?
Short answer, no. Because Harlem attempts to be as unonpinionated as possible that means it's up to you to structure your store how you see fit. That being said here are 2 examples that may give you a headstart:

#### Single file structure
```
- stores
    - store1
        state.js
        getters.js
        mutations.js
        actions.js
        store.js
        index.js
    - store2
        state.js
        getters.js
        mutations.js
        actions.js
        store.js
        index.js
```

#### Multi-file structure
```
- stores
    - store1
        - getters
            getter-1.js
            getter-2.js
        - mutations
            mutation-1.js
            mutation-2.js
        - actions
            action-1.js
            action-2.js
        state.js
        store.js
        index.js
    - store2
        - getters
            getter-1.js
            getter-2.js
        - mutations
            mutation-1.js
            mutation-2.js
        - actions
            action-1.js
            action-2.js
        state.js
        store.js
        index.js
```

In both cases the `store.js` file and the `index.js` files would look roughly the same.

```typescript
// store.js

import STATE from './state';

import {
    createStore
} from '@harlem/core';

export const {
    state,
    getter,
    mutation,
    ...store
} = createStore('store1', STATE);
```

```typescript
// index.js - single file structure

export {
    state
} from './store';

export {
    getter1,
    getter2
} from './getters';

export {
    mutation1,
    mutation2
} from './mutations';
```

```typescript
// index.js - multi-file structure

export {
    state
} from './store';

export { default as getter1 } from './getters/getter-1';
export { default as getter2 } from './getters/getter-2';

export { default as mutation1 } from './mutations/mutation-1';
export { default as mutation2 } from './mutations/mutation-2';
```

### Is Harlem suitable for large projects?

Absolutely! Harlem is currently being used by [Fathom](https://www.fathomhq.com/) to power their extensive financial intelligence product. The Fathom implementation consists of several stores with hundreds of getters, mutations and actions.

If you are using Harlem in a large project and would be comfortable in sharing your experience, please let me know.
