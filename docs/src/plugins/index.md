# Plugins
At it's heart, Harlem uses a plugin system to extend functionality and create powerful additions to your stores.

If you require functionality to suit a specific use-case you can write your own plugin. Refer to the [Plugin authoring](/plugins/advanced/authoring) documentation on how to write your own plugin.

If you feel that there is a piece of common functionality that should be included as an official Harlem plugin please open an issue providing a description of the plugin, the intended API and, if possible, a working example in a codesandbox.
