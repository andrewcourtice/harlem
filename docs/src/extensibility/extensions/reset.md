### Registration

To get started simply register this extension with the store you wish to extend.

```typescript{16,19}
import resetExtension from '@harlem/extension-reset';

import {
    createStore
} from '@harlem/core';

const STATE = {
    firstName: 'Jane',
    lastName: 'Smith'
};

const {
    state,
    getter,
    mutation,
    reset
} = createStore('example', STATE, {
