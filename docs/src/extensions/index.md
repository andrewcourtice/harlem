# Extensions

Extensions are per-store additions to Harlem's core functionaility. Extensions are often used for adding store features, changing store behaviour and various other low-level tasks. This is the primary method in which Harlem stores are extended.

If you require functionality to suit a specific use-case you can write your own extension. Refer to the [Extension authoring](/extensions/advanced/authoring) documentation on how to write your own extension.

If you feel that there is a piece of common functionality that should be included as an official Harlem extension please open an issue providing a description of the extension, the intended API and, if possible, a working example in a codesandbox.
